A simple boilerplate for one page Meteor websites. This boilerplate contains a basic navigation bar and a clear structure for the files. I have not added any front-end frameworks as I use different front-end frameworks for different projects. 

The file structure that I have used is: 

          ./meteor
          /client
              /lib
              /stylesheets
              /templates
                  /example
          /public
              /img
          /server
